# Personal Advent of Code Journey

## Python

Current considered TODO (outside of just solving problems):

- Inclusion of AoC modules to simplify data retrieval
- Testing suite using example cases (included in some modules)
- Solution timing via decorators
- Type checking (mypy?)
- Standardize daily setup and automate generation
