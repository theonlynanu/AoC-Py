# Thoughts on each day

- **Day 1**: Very basic, a nice warmup
- **Day 2**: Immediately more interesting, but fairly easy. Compared to problems I've seen in later years, this is very comfortable
- **Day 3**: This one was fun, and reminded me a lot of various maze-solving problems I've done in the past. I thought about maybe using a dictionary to keep track of tuples, but went for brute force instead. Had I needed to find the houses that got a specific number of presents, it would have been a different story.
- **Day 4**: Something about this reminded me of CS50 problems, although I can't quite remember what. Once I remembered how to do hashing in python, this was was easy.
- **Day 5**: I looked at this for maybe 15 seconds before just reaching for regex. I'm not _good_ at regex, but making sure the string literals were correct was the hardest part about this one.
- **Day 6**: This one took me a few tries. I seem to be quite prone to off-by-one errors, but besides that this was my favorite so far!
